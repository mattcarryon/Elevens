5♠ + 6♣
5♣ + 6♣

2. Yes because every number card has to be taken out with a pair. There can't be a number card because that would leave one card
    left, but that wouldn't be possible. It must be a J, Q, and K.

3. The game is highly luck based with very little strategy involved because each card can only be taken out if one other card is
    present. There is no benefit in picking other number cards first. I guess as you get farther into it, it would be best to
    save the triple pair as your last replacement because you would have a higher probability in drawing a card that is
    able to pair with a current card on the table.
